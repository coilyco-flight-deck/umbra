# umbra

config driven occlusion framework

![umbra - a config driven occlusion framework](assets/banner/umbra.jpg)

Occlusion is the idea. umbra sits between semi-trusted automation and the host
system, and what you did not declare does not get through. The boundary lives in
a KDL guardfile rather than in code, so it is one artifact a reviewer reads in a
sitting. umbra ships no denylist and knows nothing about your tools: policy is
yours, and umbra enforces it across two surfaces, `cli/` around subprocess exec
and `http/` around outbound requests.

It validates argv before `execve`, checks a scope token per verb, prunes every
upstream surface to what was granted, and appends every call to a rotating JSONL
audit log. A public exit-code taxonomy separates a policy refusal from a tool
failure. Full documentation in [docs/index.md](docs/index.md).

**umbra is not a sandbox.** It performs no execution isolation, and that is
deliberate rather than unfinished. Validating argv and auditing every call does
nothing to contain a process that is already running. Isolation is a container's
job, and umbra is the gate in front of it.

## Two ways in

**Generate the CLI.** `umbra` reads KDL policy plus committed locks out of a
`.umbra/` directory and builds a standalone guarded CLI with no hand-written
Go, over three transports: an HTTP API from its OpenAPI contract, a wrapped
binary, and an upstream MCP server. `--skills-out` also renders a native agent
skill and a lazy command index.

**Import the primitives.** Every package stands alone if you are adding a
boundary to an existing [urfave/cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli) v3 app.
Nothing consumer-shaped leaks into the API.

```sh
GOPRIVATE=forgejo.coilysiren.me go get forgejo.coilysiren.me/coilyco-flight-deck/umbra
```

## Install umbra

```sh
brew tap coilyco-flight-deck/tap https://forgejo.coilysiren.me/coilyco-flight-deck/homebrew-tap
brew install coilyco-flight-deck/tap/umbra
```

```powershell
scoop bucket add coilyco-flight-deck https://forgejo.coilysiren.me/coilyco-flight-deck/scoop-bucket
scoop install coilyco-flight-deck/umbra
```

Tagged releases also publish raw binaries and `SHA256SUMS` for Linux, macOS, and
Windows on amd64 and arm64. `umbra --version` reports both the driver and the
umbra ref `lock` freezes by default. It shells out to the Go toolchain to resolve
locks and build, so Go has to be present.

## Try it

[`examples/`](examples/) holds one runnable app per primitive, and
[docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) walks the first run. The shortest:

```sh
go run ./examples/policy unsafe 'foo; rm -rf /'
```

## Status and development

v0.x. Minor API breaks land on `main` with a note in the commit body and no
deprecation cycle, so pin a commit in your `go.mod` until v1.0.0. The API locks
once a second consumer lands. Forgejo is canonical and the GitHub mirror is
verified. umbra is deliberately unguarded, being the framework rather than a
consumer of one, so its dev verbs run through the [`Makefile`](Makefile):
`make build test lint vet`, and `make docs-serve` for the rendered docs.
