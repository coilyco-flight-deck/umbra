# specverb request semantics

How the one generic action behind every mounted leaf assembles, previews, and fires its HTTP request. The engine and policy layers are in [specverb.md](specverb.md).

## Inputs

- **Path params** become positional args (`repo delete <owner> <repo>`), count-validated before any wire call.
- **Query params** become typed flags. Set scalars encode once, while typed
  arrays encode as repeated keys in input order. Unset values are omitted.
  Inline descriptors may give one query parameter a safe local flag/schema name
  and an explicit upstream wire name.
- **Body fields** (scalars and arrays of scalars) become typed flags; an unset optional is omitted from the JSON, never sent as a zero value. Arrays repeat the flag (`--assignees a --assignees b`).
- **`--body-file <path>`** supplies the whole JSON body instead, mutually exclusive with body flags.
- **Required body fields** are enforced at request assembly, not the CLI layer, so either source - flags or `--body-file` - satisfies them.
- **State toggles** (`can close issues`) mount fixed-body leaves: the leaf sends exactly the table-declared body (`{"state":"closed"}`) and mounts no body flags.

A promoted local input that would shadow a reserved engine flag (`--dry-run`, `--query`, `--output`, `--body-file`), or a query/body name collision on one leaf, refuses to build - fail-closed, never silent shadowing. An explicit query alias changes only the outgoing parameter name. The local name still passes the reserved and duplicate checks, and two inputs cannot map to one outgoing parameter.

Inline query blocks add bounds, required fields, and at-most-one groups through
the shared schema and request runtime. The specverb CLI converts set flags to
typed values and delegates the same pre-send validation to opcore. See
[opcore-query-types.md](opcore-query-types.md).

## The shell-metachar gate is location-aware

The argv gate (`verb.Wrap` → `policy.ValidateArg`) refuses shell metacharacters, but only on the inputs that compose into the request **URL** - the injection surface. **Path params** (positionals) and **query flags** stay gated. Every element of a repeated query parameter is checked independently. **Body fields**, **form fields**, and the `--body-file` path are JSON/multipart-encoded into the HTTP body and never reach a shell or the URL, so they are exempt. Gating them was a false positive that mangled legitimate free text (descriptions, commit messages, issue bodies). Complex-action inputs are gated by the same rule: an input is gated when any leaf binds it to a path or query param, exempt when it flows only into a body.

## Firing

- **Auth** (header-token) resolves the secret through the value-provider registry (`value <provider> "addr"`), keeping the AWS SDK and other store clients out of umbra - the consumer registers the real `ssm`/`tailscale` resolvers, tests inject a fake or lean on the `env`/`file`/`literal` built-ins.
- **`--dry-run`** prints the resolved request with the secret redacted and fires nothing.
- Live responses render through the `respfmt` `--query`/`--output` rail; an empty 2xx prints an `ok:` confirmation line.
- The default client refuses redirects for mutating methods, so a renamed or transferred target cannot silently swallow a write.

A spec-declared non-JSON media type skips the decode and the render rail, see
[specverb-raw-responses.md](specverb-raw-responses.md).

## Fetch overlays

Fetch overlays are the raw-stdout sibling of the spec-driven leaf path:

- The method and path are fixed in the Guardfile.
- Path placeholders still become positional args in `{placeholder}` order.
- Env-backed header templates resolve through the same value-provider registry.
- The live response body prints raw, without the `respfmt` rail.
- A non-2xx response fails closed with the status line and trimmed body.
- The same client floor applies, so `GET` and `HEAD` may follow redirects while mutating methods refuse silent redirects.
