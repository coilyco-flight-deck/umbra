# install specgen

Homebrew on macOS or Linux:

```sh
brew tap coilyco-flight-deck/tap https://forgejo.coilysiren.me/coilyco-flight-deck/homebrew-tap.git
brew install coilyco-flight-deck/tap/specgen
```

Scoop on Windows:

```sh
scoop bucket add coilyco https://forgejo.coilysiren.me/coilyco-flight-deck/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install coilyco/specgen
```

Each umbra tag also publishes raw `specgen` binaries for Linux, macOS, and
Windows on amd64 and arm64. Verify the selected binary against the release's
`SHA256SUMS`, rename it to `specgen` (or `specgen.exe`), and place it on
`PATH`.

Go users can install the tagged command directly:

```sh
GOPRIVATE=forgejo.coilysiren.me go install forgejo.coilysiren.me/coilyco-flight-deck/umbra/cmd/specgen@vX.Y.Z
```

The packaged driver still invokes the Go toolchain for `lock`, `build`, and
`run`. `specgen --version` prints the driver version and the umbra module
ref that an unqualified `lock` will freeze. Release binaries and tagged
`go install` builds report the same tag for both values. A source checkout
reports `(devel)` and defaults the lock ref to `latest`.

The legacy `cmd/kdl-specs` Go path remains a temporary compatibility
entrypoint for pinned consumers. New installations use `cmd/specgen`, and
releases publish only `specgen` assets.
