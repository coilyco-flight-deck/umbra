# Release pipeline

Forgejo is the canonical and only publication surface for umbra. GitHub
does not build or publish releases and does not deploy documentation.
umbra is the base library of the umbra / ward stack (coily, the
original third member, has been retired).

## Flow

Two-stage (ward#1117): main is the integration branch, `release` is
last-known-good, and only gate-green shas release.

- Push to `main` lands on Forgejo and fires `.forgejo/workflows/promote.yml`
  (stage 1): the full repo gate (vet, build, race test, godoc-current, mod
  tidy, golangci-lint, secret scan) runs, then the workflow publishes the
  commit-scoped draft tag (`draft-${sha}`) and only then fast-forwards
  `release` to that sha. The promote push uses the `CI_RELEASE_TOKEN` secret
  (a real-user PAT with `write:repository` + `read:user` from SSM
  `/forgejo/ci-release-token`, synced by aos `ward exec sync-actions-secrets`):
  job-token pushes and PATs without `read:user` get an empty actor and
  silently enqueue no workflow.
- The `release` push fires `.forgejo/workflows/release.yml` (stage 2) under a
  no-cancel concurrency queue, so promoted shas release in sequence. The
  workflow first verifies the matching draft tag exists, then the **release**
  job: `tag-bump` applies the automatic minor bump (major stays hand-driven),
  creates the tag, then
  builds the six-platform `specgen` matrix, renders and verifies the Homebrew
  formula plus Scoop manifest, creates the Forgejo release, and attaches every
  binary plus `SHA256SUMS`, `specgen.rb`, and `specgen.json`. It then updates
  the shared Homebrew tap and Scoop bucket. Release creation uses the
  auto-issued job token. Package-repository pushes use the repo-scoped
  `TAP_WRITE_TOKEN` and `SCOOP_WRITE_TOKEN` secrets provisioned by
  infrastructure's bot-token scripts.

The release assets cover Linux, macOS, and Windows on amd64 and arm64. The
stamped `specgen` version is also the default umbra ref frozen by
`specgen lock`. A tagged `go install` is the source-install alternative.
Homebrew and Scoop metadata carry the same release URLs and hashes as the
attached binaries. `make release-check` verifies that contract before
publication.

## Tag-only by design: umbra does not bump its consumers

The stack's dependency direction is umbra -> ward. umbra is
the base, so its automation must not reach up into its consumers. Having
umbra open dependency-bump PRs on ward would reverse the
`dependsOn` edge (a dependency mutating its dependents), which couples the
tree backwards.

Downstream bumps belong to the consumers, pulled along the dependency arrow:
ward watches umbra's tags and opens its own self-bump PR.
That keeps every cross-repo write pointing from a consumer toward what it
depends on. The tree-direction rule is being made enforceable as a linter in
the consumer self-bump policy.
