# umbra features

Inventory of umbra today, grouped by **guarded surface** over a shared `pkg/`. See [architecture.md](architecture.md). Each primitive ships a walkthrough in `guides/`. Dev verbs run through the `justfile`. Release is automated and Forgejo-canonical, with commit-scoped draft tags on `main` ([release-pipeline.md](release-pipeline.md)).

## CLI exec surface (`cli/`)

- **execverb** - Exec-dialect KDL verbs, complex actions, and inspect lists. A guardfile may `withhold` a verb as a stated refusal rather than a silent absence, `pin` a flag to one value umbra supplies and a caller cannot override, and declare `resolve-flag` so umbra resolves that flag's value through `pkg/valuesource` and spills it to a file rather than forwarding an argv token. See [execverb.md](execverb.md) and [occlusion primitives](execverb-occlusion.md).
- **execverb default-allow** - A wrap declaring `default-allow` inverts the dialect's closed default for that wrap alone: an unnamed verb is forwarded to the wrapped binary and the guardfile names only what it refuses or constrains. The declaration requires a `reason`, the wrap-level guards and env injections still bind on a forwarded call, and the shapes where it would have two answers (a `can run *` funnel, an `allow` list, or naming nothing at all) fail closed at parse. Paired with `replace` it is what lets a replacement name only its boundary rather than inventory the tool. See [default-allow](execverb-default-allow.md).
- **execverb replacements** - A wrap declaring `replace` builds a binary installed under the wrapped tool's own name rather than as a verb under a driver's tree, so the guardfile's grants are the whole tool a caller sees. `umbra install` places it and `umbra doctor` reports what it occludes. See [occluded replacement binaries](execverb-replacement.md).
- **negative controls** - `umbra controls` invokes every `never`, `cannot` and `withhold` rule, then again without it, and fails if one does not hold. See [negative controls](negative-controls.md).
- **verb** - Middleware wrapping every `*cli.Command.Action` in the validate -> execute -> audit pipeline, with audited argv and env injection.

## HTTP request surface (`http/`)

- **specverb / guardfile** - Spec-driven verbs: [resolution](specverb-resolution.md), [policy](specverb-policy.md), [requests](specverb-request.md), [actions](specverb-actions.md), [describe](specverb-describe.md), [fetch](specverb-fetch.md), [descriptors](specverb-descriptors.md) for a consumer that mounts operations onto something other than a cli tree.
- **mcpverb** - MCP-shaped verbs: one `can call` grant per guarded leaf against an upstream MCP server, flags typed from the committed tool lock, deny by absence. `ServedTools` projects the same grants back into tool definitions for a consumer that serves them, and a grant's `widget` block declares what that tool's MCP Apps view may call back. See [mcpverb.md](mcpverb.md).
- **YAML and TOML guardfiles** - A guardfile may be written in YAML or TOML. The file is lowered to KDL text before any loader runs, so the KDL loaders remain the only owner of grammar and every fail-closed check still applies. A hand-written schema covers the wrap header, auth, restrict, grants, and typed bodies, and a `kdl` escape carries any node it does not name. `inherit` crosses formats, and project discovery skips YAML or TOML with no `wrap`. See [guardfile formats](guardfile-formats.md).
- **mcpverb upstream guardfiles** - The other shape a `.mcp.kdl` file takes: `mcp-upstream` states where a proxied MCP server is, what credential reaches it, and which of its tools may be called, with no command path and no tool lock. `Classify` tells the two shapes apart before either parser runs. See [mcpverb-upstream.md](mcpverb-upstream.md).
- **umbra / codegen** - The no-code driver: discovery, locks, generation, over three transports (spec, exec, mcp). See [umbra-cli.md](umbra-cli.md) and [materialization](umbra-materialization.md).
- **opcore** - The frozen inline grammar: typed query, body projection, GraphQL and SQL grants, JMESPath postconditions, MCP proxy grants, a named client, and a `returns` declaration pruned onto every response. A body object may be `keyed` (caller keys sharing one `entry` shape) or a `variant` (a discriminated union). See [opcore-inline.md](opcore-inline.md), [opcore-body.md](opcore-body.md), [opcore-body-variants.md](opcore-body-variants.md), and [opcore-returns.md](opcore-returns.md).
- **respfmt** - JSON renderer with optional JMESPath projection and five output formats, mirroring the aws CLI `--query` / `--output` surface.
- **openapigen** - `umbra openapi` renders the granted subset of an upstream as an OpenAPI 3.1 document. Pinned body values emit as `const`, withheld verbs are absent, a skipped leaf is named, and `returns` becomes its `200` schema. See [openapigen.md](openapigen.md).

## Shared core (`pkg/`)

- **audit** - Append-only JSONL invocation log with rotation and optional typed CI attribution, which it preserves but does not establish trust in. Records project onto tracing spans through `Record.SpanOf()` and a `Sink`, carrying the exit-code taxonomy so a refusal is distinguishable from a failure. `pkg/audit/otelsink` emits them as OpenTelemetry spans and can wire an OTLP exporter. See [audit spans](audit-spans.md).
- **policy** - Argv validation rejecting shell metacharacters before `execve`. On the HTTP surfaces the gate is location-scoped to path values, the only inputs `FillPath` substitutes unescaped, and a wrap opts a named path param out with `allow-metacharacters`. See [the gate section](specverb-request.md#the-shell-metachar-gate-is-location-aware).
- **scope** / **exitcode** - Resolve cwd to its git toplevel for each audit row's RepoRoot, and a public exit-code taxonomy for orchestrators. A generated binary exits with the code its error declares (2 for a policy refusal, 5 for a user error), and the audit row records the same code. Its decision is `reject` exactly when that code is 2, which every guardfile refusal of a granted verb carries.
- **valuesource** / **tokenmint** - Shared `value <provider>` resolution with
  fallback chains, plus OAuth `client_credentials` tokens minted rather than
  read. See [value providers](value-providers.md).
- **config** / **stepflow** / **flock** / **skillgen** - Cache and audit-path derivation rooted at the consumer's app dir, a transport-agnostic ordered sequence engine, an advisory build lock, and the skill projection the driver emits.
- **mcpclient** - The Model Context Protocol client the mcp dialect speaks: one declared upstream over stdio or Streamable HTTP, the calls the dialect needs, and an optional progress sink. Policy-free, so it sits in the core.
- **mcpapps** - The MCP Apps host bridge: the frames a rendered widget sends back, answered under the guardfile's `widget` block rather than forwarded. Tool calls, resource reads, link opens, and downloads each take their own grant, and progress rides back under the view's own token. Transport-free and policy-free, so a consumer supplies the presenter and `http/mcpverb` supplies the policy. See [mcpapps.md](mcpapps.md).

## Two front doors

Every package above is reached through **umbra** (the driver and the binaries it generates) or through **beaver** (`mcp-beaver`, which imports `guardfile`, `opcore`, `specverb`, `tokenmint`, and `valuesource`). A package no front door reaches does not belong here.

ward was a third door and is deprecated. What only ward needed - `cli/{gittree,passthrough,repocfg,shell}`, `http/egress`, and `pkg/{attribution,broker,credseed,issueref,ownertrust,provenance,scan,version}` - was removed rather than kept for a consumer that is going away.
