# the no-code driver (specgen / cmd/specgen)

`ward-kdl` is a **no-code** CLI: the consumer authors policy plus committed
locks, never Go or build glue. `specgen` is its driver. Every spec may carry a
top-level [`description`](kdl-description.md) node for standing context.

## Install

See [install specgen](specgen-install.md) for release binaries, checksums,
`go install`, and the driver-to-framework version contract.

## Discovery and merging

A `--guardfile` selects a **binary**, not the whole build: members compose only when their parsed `wrap <binary>` name (`Group[0]`) agrees. A different wrap name is a **separate** binary, never merged in.

A repository can place its recursive project under `.specgen/` and invoke the driver without discovery flags. Pass `--project-root <dir>` for another explicit boundary; a `--guardfile <path>` inside it selects that member's binary group. See [specgen discovery](specgen-discovery.md) for membership, mixed-dialect, identity, and fail-closed rules.

`gen`, `build`, and `run` accept `--binary <name>` to rename the generated
command and build output. Discovery and policy identity still come from `wrap`.

Locks are per member and preserve root-relative directories. `main.go`,
`specverb.lock`, and generated skills are per binary. The override env var is
keyed on the full wrap group. Spec and exec members can share one binary - see
[mixed transports](specverb-mixed-transports.md).

Exec grants may add [embedded fixed files](specgen-embedded-files.md). Specgen
compiles their bytes into the binary and supplies absolute runtime paths.

## The five verbs

- **`gen`** - render merged `main.go` into the cache, or use `--out` to inspect it.
- **`lock`** - the deliberate online step. For each member, reads a [vendored source](specgen-vendored-sources.md) or fetches upstream Swagger, **prunes it to the granted surface**, and writes the deterministic gzip lock. It then resolves and freezes the merged module graph in `specverb.lock`. `--umbra-ref` pins the framework version; `--umbra-replace` points at a local checkout.
- **`skew`** - prune live upstream to the granted surface and diff it against each committed lock. Exit 3 on drift and never write.
- **`build`** - materialize the binary **out-of-band** (same cache + staleness path as `run`) and copy it to `--out` (default `bin`) instead of execing it. `--out` follows `go build -o`: a directory (or trailing `/`) takes the generated binary name, else it is the explicit file path. Windows adds `.exe` to either form when it is absent. `--binary <name>` sets that generated name, defaulting to the Guardfile-derived binary. `--set-version <v>` stamps the binary's `--version` via `-ldflags`, default `dev`. Refuses without committed locks.
- **`run`** - materialize the consumer binary **out-of-band** and exec it with passed-through args.

## Generated agent skill

Specgen writes no documentation or skill by default. The explicit persistent
`--skills-out <root>` flag renders one deterministic native skill from the
merged command tree. See [generated skills](specgen-skills.md) for its files,
authority boundary, and lifecycle.

## Out-of-band materialization

`run` and `build` share the [materialization](specgen-materialization.md) cache, keyed by generated binary name and root-relative member identities.

## The two locks

The committed build artifacts are:

- **`<spec>.lock.json.gz`** - one generated, gzip-encoded pruned API snapshot per member, placed beneath that member's root-relative directory when `--project-root` is used. Specgen reads the former plain `<spec>.lock.json` name until the next `lock` refresh replaces it.
- **`specverb.lock`** - one frozen Go dependency graph per binary.

See [specgen-materialization.md](specgen-materialization.md) for cache and offline-build detail.
