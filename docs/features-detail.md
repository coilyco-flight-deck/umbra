# cli-guard features (detail)

Per-primitive detail behind the [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) index.

- **audit** - Append-only JSONL invocation log with lumberjack rotation and optional typed CI attribution supplied by the consumer. The package preserves that context but does not establish its trust. Foundation for the rest.
- **policy** - Argv validation rejecting shell metacharacters before they reach `execve`.
- **hook** - Shared Claude Code PreToolUse engine. Consumers register integrity rules and routing hints; the engine owns a non-configurable deny on arbitrary-code execution (interpreter invocation, execution from a writable scratch dir) that fires on every segment of a compound command, so a denied prefix cannot launder behind an allowed token or a `/tmp` shebang.
- **verb** - Middleware wrapping every `*cli.Command.Action` in the standard pipeline (validate → execute → audit).
- **scope** - Resolve cwd to its git toplevel, best-effort, stamping each audit row's forensic RepoRoot (empty outside any repo).
- **exitcode** - Public exit-code taxonomy (success / generic / policy-denied / upstream-failed / internal / user-error) for orchestrators.
- **gittree** - Clean+synced gate refusing repo-shaped verbs on a dirty tree.
- **passthrough** - Thin wrapper that embeds an existing binary (aws, gh, kubectl, ...) as an audited urfave subcommand.
- **repocfg** - Per-repo config loaded from a consumer-chosen YAML filename.
- **egress** - Per-invocation CONNECT proxy with consumer-supplied allowlist. Enforce / observe modes.
- **respfmt** - JSON response renderer with optional JMESPath projection and five output formats (yaml, yaml-stream, json, text, table). Mirrors aws CLI's `--query` / `--output` surface; default flipped to yaml for editor-friendly piped output.
- **skillgen** - Render an urfave/cli command tree into a deterministic markdown lookup table or yaml document. Pairs with verb: every wrapped Action is reachable by name from the output, so the rendered file mirrors the invocation surface.
- **config** - Layered-config primitives: `~/<app-dir>` and `./<app-dir>` path helpers, `ExpandHome`, audit-slug derivation from `git remote get-url origin`, the `Audit` rotation-knobs struct, and a generic `OverlayFile[T]` helper.
- **guardfile**, **specverb**, **opcore** - Spec-driven verb subsystem, exact nested-string request body projection, and the frozen inline MCP proxy grammar. See [specverb.md](specverb.md) and [opcore-inline.md](opcore-inline.md).
