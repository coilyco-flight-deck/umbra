# occlusion primitives in the exec dialect

Primitives in [the exec dialect](execverb.md) that state more than presence or absence. They came down from mcp-beaver, where they were first needed, because none of them is MCP-shaped: they are about occlusion, and the rendering is the only part that differs between a tool listing and `--help` (umbra#6821). Three are grant-level. `reject-empty` is action-level, for the reason its section gives.

## Stating an absence: `withhold`

Deny-by-absence is the default and stays the default. But absence carries four meanings at once - withheld by policy, not implemented, not offered by the binary, or simply not matched by the caller's search - and a caller reasoning from a hole has to guess which. The guesses go wrong both ways: a real capability gets worked around because it looked absent, or a workaround gets built for a restriction that was never there.

`withhold` converts one silence into a statement:

```kdl
withhold delete {
    reason "Deleting a repo exceeds what this audit trail can reconstruct."
    alternative "archive"
}
```

The verb mounts in the tree and appears in `--help`, with the usage leading `NOT AVAILABLE - withheld by policy.` so a reader scanning the first clause rules it out. Calling it fails `policy_denied`, carrying the reason and the alternative. **It reaches no binary and holds no credential**, so this is not a weakening of deny-by-absence: an undeclared verb is still absent, and a stub is a declared refusal rather than a narrowed grant.

`reason` is required. A stub that does not say why is the silence it was meant to replace, only louder.

Three things fail closed at build:

- A stub naming a verb the guardfile **grants**. It would advertise a working verb as refused, and the grant would look revoked with nothing revoking it.
- An `alternative` no grant mints, which sends a caller hunting for a verb they will never find.
- A stub beside `can run *` or an `allow` list. A funnel takes the whole group, so anything mounted under it is unreachable rather than merely redundant.

## Pinning a flag's value

`pin "<--flag>" "<value>"` fixes a flag the caller cannot change. umbra supplies it when the call omits it, and refuses the call when it passes a different value.

```kdl
can run ssm put-parameter {
    pin "--type" "SecureString"
}
```

A `when` guard gets refusal; a pin gets **correctness by construction**. For a flag whose only safe value is one constant, the second is better: nothing to type, nothing to get wrong, and the guardfile stops depending on every caller remembering (umbra#6821). Passing the pinned value is not a conflict, so a caller who spells it out agrees with the policy rather than tripping it.

A pin implies `value-flag`, since a pinned flag necessarily takes a separate token, so an `argN` guard beside one does not read the pinned value as a positional.

Pins apply **before** the gates and guards, so a `when` reads the argv that will actually run. That is the opposite of `resolve-flag` below, and deliberately: a pin changes *what* the call does, so a guard must see the change; a resolve-flag changes only how a value travels, so a guard must see what the caller typed.

`argv-prefix` is the neighbouring tool and a different one: it is wrap-level and prepends unoverridable leading argv, not a per-flag value.

## Resolving a flag's value instead of passing it through

`resolve-flag <name>` declares that umbra reads the flag's value rather than forwarding it. umbra resolves the caller's token through `pkg/valuesource`, writes the result to a mode-0600 file it owns, and hands the subprocess `file://<that path>`, unlinking it once the command exits. It implies `value-flag`, since a resolved flag necessarily takes a separate token.

```kdl
can run ssm put-parameter {
    resolve-flag "--value"
}
```

The caller's token selects the source: a `<provider>://` prefix naming a registered provider (`file://`, `env://`, or a consumer-declared one) resolves through it, and anything else is a `literal`. So `--value file:///path/to/token` is read and **trimmed**, and `--value s3cret` is spilled untrimmed but still leaves argv.

Two properties follow, and both were the point (umbra#6830):

- **The value goes through the trim policy the read path already uses.** `valuesource` trims a `file` or `env` source because a machine put the newline there, and leaves a `literal` intact because a reviewer can see it. Before this, `--value file:///path` was an opaque argv token the wrapped CLI opened itself, so umbra never saw the bytes and the provider that would have trimmed them was never called. A secret arriving 72 bytes stored at 72, and failed days later as a credential that reads correctly at a glance.
- **The value never sits in argv**, whichever form the caller used, so it stays out of `ps`, `/proc/*/cmdline`, and any argv-capturing audit row.

Resolution runs **after** every gate, guard, and flag-policy check, so a guard always reads what the caller actually typed rather than a path umbra just invented. It runs on the passthrough verb and on an action step, because a declared flag that bound on only one of the two paths would be a hole rather than a guard. A `--dry-run` plan resolves nothing and writes no file: it stays symbolic.

A source that cannot be read fails closed before any exec, and the error names the provider and address, never the value.

## Refusing an empty answer: `reject-empty`

A command that succeeds and prints nothing hands its caller a blank that reads exactly like a real answer, and a model reading one writes as though it had a result. `reject-empty` says so instead, and a refusal is something the caller can act on.

Opt-in and off by default, because emptiness is a legitimate answer for some commands: a search with no hits returns an empty list correctly, and refusing that would turn a right result into an error.

```kdl
action list-holds {
    reject-empty
    call list holds { }
}
```

It takes no argument, unlike the mcp-beaver control it came from, where a top-level node had to name which projected tool it governed. Here the action it sits in names itself.

### Why it is not `fail-when`

`fail-when` already turns a result into a non-zero exit, so a reasonable reading is that this is sugar over a predicate an author could have written. It is not, and the difference is one value.

`fail-when` reduces the answer through **JMESPath truthiness**, where `null`, `false`, `""`, `[]` and `{}` are all false. `reject-empty` calls the same set empty **except `false`**. A command answering "no" has answered, and refusing that is the failure this control exists to prevent rather than to cause. `0` is an answer on both readings.

The second difference is shape. `fail-when` decodes the output as JSON and fails the run as an internal error when it will not parse, so a command that prints prose cannot be gated by it at all. `reject-empty` reads bytes: blank or whitespace-only is empty, and anything else that is not JSON is prose with something in it, so it is an answer.

`reject-empty` runs first when both are declared, so the precise reason wins over a predicate that merely happened to match nothing.

### Why it is action-level

The grant-level primitives above attach to a `can run` grant. This one cannot, because the plain exec path wires the child's stdout straight to umbra's own and never holds the bytes. Only an action captures output, so only an action can judge it.

Giving a plain grant this control means capturing its output, which ends streaming for every long-running command that has it. That is a real trade rather than an oversight, and it is not made here.

The shared parser accepts `reject-empty` on any action, so an http guardfile can state it. The http surface **refuses it at build time** rather than ignoring it: a control that silently does nothing is worse than one that is absent.
